### Operators and Motions
- Combine opeator (say, `c`) with motion (`2w`) → `c2w`

*`c` and `d` operator*
- `dw` → deletes up to the position where the motion goes. It does not delete the last character of next word.
- `de` → deletes till the end of the current word.
- `ce` or `cw` → Changes till the end of current word.
- `cw` vs `dw`
	- In case of `d` operator the space after the word in included.
	- This is an exception that dates back to the old Vi.  Since many people are used to it now, the inconsistency has remained in Vim.

### Some Useful Changes and Shortcuts
- `dd` → Delete whole line
- `cc` → Change whole line. Indentation is maintained.
- `x` == `dl`
- `X` == `dh`
- `D` == `d$`
- `s` == `cl`
- `S` == `cc`
- `C` == `c$`
- `r` → Replace with one character
- Note: `x` and `s` are comparable. `X` and `S` are not comparable.

### Where to Put the Count
- `3dw` and `d3w` has difference without a distinction.
- `3dw` → 3 times `dw`.
- `d3w` → delete 3 words at once.

### Repeat Last Change
- `.` command repeats last atomic change.

*Exceptions*
- `.` command works for all changes, except for 
	- `u` (undo)
	- `CTRL-r` (redo) 
	- commands that start with a colon (:).


### Visual Mode
- When simple operator-motion changes is not possible, visual mode is useful.
- `v` → Visual Mode
- `V` → Visual Line Mode
- `Ctrl-v` → Visual Block Mode

*Jump to other side of selection*
- In Visual Mode → `o` jumps between 2 ends.
- In Visual Line Mode → `o` jumps between initial and final cursor position. (I am not sure though.)
- In Visual Block Mode → `o` jumps diagonally, `O` jumps linearly.

### Moving Text
- Swap 2 characters → `xp`
- Swap 2 lines → `ddp`

### Copying text
- `y` operator
- `yw` yanks word including the white space.
- `ye` yanks word without the white space.
- `yy` yanks the whole line.

### Clipboard
- In `gvim` it works "as expected".
- In terminal vim 
	- Copy to clipboard → `"*y{motion}`
	- Paste from clipboard → `"*p`

### Text Object
- Similar to operator-motion, operator-text object can also be combined.

*`iw` Text Object*
- Inside Word

*`aw` Text Object*
- A Word.
- White space after the word is also included (or the white space before the word if at
the end of the line).

*`is` and `as` Text Object*
- Innner sentence
- A Sentence → Includes white space.

*Example*
- `daw`→ Deletes a word including whitespace.
- `cis` → Changes a sentence.

### Replace Mode
- `R` command put in replace mode.
- Each character typed replace the one undeer cursor.
- Automatically extends if line runs out of characters. Does not go to next line.
- `<Insert>` key toggles between insert and replace mode.
- `<BS>` key returns old text, like undo.

### Miscellaneous Changes
- `~` → Change case of character under cursor. It is not an operator. Works in visual mode.
- `I` → Jump to first non-blank character and puts in insert mode.
- `A` → Jump to end of line and puts in insert mode.
