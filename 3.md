### Word Movement
*Start of word*
- Forward → `w`
- Backward → `b`

*End of word*
- Forward → `e`
- Backward → `ge`

*Note*
- Word ends at a non-word character
- What is part of a word → `:help 'iskeyword'`

### Start and End of a Line
- Move to very first character → `0`
- Move to first non-blank character → `^`
- Move to end of line → `$`

### Move to character in line
- Forward at the character → `f{char}`
- Backward at the character → `F{char}`
- Forward before the character → `t{char}`
- Backward before the character → `T{char}`

*Repeat the above four commands*
- Forward → `;`
- Backward → `,`

### Matching parenthesis
- `%`
- Works for (), {}, [] pairs
- To add other matching pairs → `:help 'matchpairs'`

### Moving to Specific Line
- First line → `9999k` or `gg`
- Last line → `G`
- Specific line (say, 33)
	1. `9999k` or `gg` to go top of the file and then `32j` to go down at 33rd line.
	2. `33G`
- Jump at specific percentage
	- `50%` to jump to middle.
- Jump within visible lines.
	- High (Top) → `H`
	- Middle → `M`
	- Low (Bottom) → `L`

### Current position in a file
*Ctrl-g*
- If `ruler` is off, it shows current position in the file.

*`number` option*
- `set number` option will display line number for each line.

*`ruler` option*
- `set ruler` will display cursor position in lower right corner.

### Scrolling Around
*Scroll by full screen* 
- Forward → `Ctrl-f`
- Backward → `Ctrl-b`

*Scroll by half screen* 
- Upward → `Ctrl-u`
- Downward → `Ctrl-d`

*Scroll by one line*
- Up → `Ctrl-e`
- Down → `Ctrl-y`

*Move cursor with context*
- Top of visible area → zt
- Middle of visible area → zz
- Bottom of visible area → zb
- To always keep few lines of context → `:h 'scrolloff'`

### Searches
*Search by typing*
- Forward → `/`
- Backward → `?`

*Search with word boundary*
- `/\<MyWord\>`

*Search for word under cursor*
- Forward → `*`
- Backward → `#`
- It can be prepended with count.
- These two finds with word boundary.
- To match partial word → `g*` and `g#`

*Tweak highlight matches*
- To remove (permanent) highlight → `set nohlsearch`
- To disable (temporary) highlight → `:nohlsearch`
- To disable highlight while typing → `set noincsearch`

*Notes*
- For case insensitive search → `set ignorecase`
- To search same as last search you don't need to give pattern.
- To stop search at end of the file for forward search or start of the file for backward search → `set nowrapscan`

### Jumps and Marks
- When jump from a line, vim marks the position (before jump) with backtick. So we can jump back with two backticks.
- Since moving using mark is itself a jump, two backticks toggles between 2 last jumps.
- To jump to older and newer positions of jump → `Ctrl-o` and `Ctrl-i`
- See list of jumps done → `:jumps`
- Named marks → `m<letter>`
- List of marks → `:marks`
- Special marks
	- `'` → Cursor before jump
	- `"` → Cursor position while last edit.
	- `[` → Start of last change
	- `]` → End of last change
